A Simple Calculator in JavaScript is a basic calculator application built using
the JavaScript programming language. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations
such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator can handle positive
and negative numbers, decimals, and can display the result in real-time as users type in the 
numbers and choose the operations. The code for the calculator is relatively straightforward 
and can be a great starting point for those who are new to JavaScript and want to learn how 
to build a simple application.
